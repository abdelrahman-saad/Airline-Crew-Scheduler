# CSCE 361 Capstone Project Scoping Document

The university's [Fifteenth Week Policy](https://registrar.unl.edu/academic-standards/policies/fifteenth-week-policy/) states:

>   [I]f the instructor is replacing the final exam with either a project,
    paper, or speech, the due date for the assignment can be any time during
    the 15th week or during finals week (providing that the assignment has been
    given by the eighth week).

The course's capstone project replaces the final exam. This Scoping Document
satisfies the Fifteenth Week Policy's requirement that that the project and
scope, but not the topic, be made available to you no later than the end of the
eighth week.

In the capstone project, you will demonstrate the good software engineering
practices learned during the semester to develop a software project on a team
of 3-4 students, using the Scrum development process that you will learn about
in a few weeks.

Your development effort will consist of two sprints (the Scrum version of an
iteration) of four class periods (which is remarkably short for a sprint, but
we want you to have a multi-sprint experience). Because of the Thanksgiving
Break, the first sprint will appear to be two calendar weeks long: I do *not*
expect you to work on the project during the break, and your team's plan should
not assume that team members will work on the project during the break.

In addition to designing, coding, and testing your project, you will keep
minutes of the Scrum-related meetings (held during class time), and you will
prepare and deliver a short presentation/demonstration for your project.

##  Academic Integrity

-   This assignment is to be completed in assigned teams. You may discuss the
    requirements with other students; other than that, **no collaboration
    outside of your teams is permitted**.
-   **Copying models or code off of the internet and placing it into your
    deliverables is completely out of the question.**  You may look at examples
    to understand something you're trying to teach yourself, but *you must
    indicate these sources in the deliverables.*
-   You may copy artwork from outside sources to include in your project if and
    only if you have the license to do so.  If the artwork is in the public
    domain or is licensed under a Creative Commons license then you likely do
    not need to take explicit action to obtain the license.  Otherwise, you
    probably will have to pay for the license (be sure that the license permits
    redistribution).  *Be sure to comply with the terms of the license, whether
    it's a Creative Commons license or a commercial license, and be sure to
    indicate the source in the deliverables*.

##  Teams

-   You will work on a team of 3-4 students.
-   You may request to be teamed with other students. We will attempt to honor
    these requests but do not guarantee that we will do so.
-   Beyond such requests, teams will be formed semi-randomly. Team assignment
    will be semi-random in that we will take into account student performance
    in prior assignments, both the quality of contribution and the willingness
    to contribute.
    -   We will strive to balance the teams' collective mastery of the course
        material, so that if a student is weak in some particular area, other
        team members will be able to help them out.
    -   Except as noted below, we will assign at most one student per team
        whose prior performance indicates they are a habitual poor team member,
        either by not contributing an equitable share, or by failing to
        coordinate with other team members.
    -   If there are enough poor team members, we will create a team or teams
        consisting only of poor team members.
-   Twice during the assignment you will need to complete a peer assessment.
    Your contribution grade will be based on the peer assessments and on the
    git history.
-   **Non-performing team members** If a student is habitually failing to be a
    contributing member of your team beyond your ability to resolve, you may
    ask your TA or the professor for help resolving the problem.  In extreme
    circumstances, the professor may remove that student from the team.  This
    can occur only *after* we've discussed your team's dilemma and concurred
    that no better option is available.  A fired team member may complete the
    project on his/her own, or join a group with other fired team members (if
    any exist).
-   **Toxic team members** If a student's behavior is harming the other team
    members' ability to learn and perform, the professor may remove that
    student from the team.  This can occur only *after* we've discussed your
    team's dilemma and concurred that no better option is available.  A fired
    team member may complete the project on his/her own, or join a group with
    other fired team members (if any exist).  If necessary, the case will be
    referred to Student Affairs for appropriate action.
