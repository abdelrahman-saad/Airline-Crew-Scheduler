#   Agendas and Minutes

This directory contains three agendas.

-   `agenda-20191120.md` is a notional agenda for your combined kickoff meeting
    and sprint 1 planning meeting
-   `agenda-20191204.md` is a notional agenda for your combined sprint 1 review/
    retrospective and sprint 2 planning meeting
-   `agenda-scrum-meeting.md` is a notional agenda for your "daily" scrum
    meetings on the other class days

You may modify these agendas to suit your needs. Use the agendas to form the
outlines of the minutes for your meetings, which you should place in this
directory.

The name of each minutes file should be `yyyy-mm-dd.md` where *yyyy* is the
year, *mm* is the two-digit month, and *dd* is the two-digit day of the month.
For example, the minutes from the combined kickoff & sprint 1 planning meeting
would be named `2019-11-20.md`.

The minutes for each meeting are due at 11:59pm on the day of the that meeting.
